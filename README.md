This is project where I learn html and css in course and also where I try different things as well.
It contains multiple small and one big project.

It is based on course: Learn modern HTML5, CSS3 and web design by building a stunning website for your portfolio! Includes flexbox and CSS Grid by Jonas Schmedtmann.
